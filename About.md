# Zietaiber Framework for Consciousness Expansion

## Introduction
The **Zietaiber Framework** is a cutting-edge model for enhancing human consciousness through scalar wave dynamics, bio-cybernetic systems, and neural feedback. This framework integrates scalar waves and bio-field energy to optimize cognitive functions and promote consciousness expansion.

## Purpose
The Zietaiber Framework is designed to enhance human potential, optimize cognitive states, and foster emotional intelligence using real-time biofeedback and quantum principles.

## Features
- Scalar wave modulation
- Biofeedback integration for cognitive enhancement
- Therapeutic water imprinting for mental wellness
- AI-driven self-learning system

## Installation
To get started with the Zietaiber Framework, clone this repository:

```bash
