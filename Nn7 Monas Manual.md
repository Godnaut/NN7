# 🜛 NN7 Monas Hieroglyphica  
### *Cybernetic Sigil Circuit for Scalar Resonance, Consciousness Navigation, and Harmonic Fieldwork*

> **Author**: Stephen John Roberts  
> **Version**: NN7  
> **Status**: Active Research Interface  

The **NN7 Monas Hieroglyphica** is a post-classical evolution of John Dee’s original sigil, redesigned as a **cybernetic interface** for scalar wave modulation, quantum harmonic entrainment, and multidimensional energetic operations. This symbol operates as a **resonant feedback machine** — part glyph, part circuit diagram, part quantum mirror — designed to function across aetheric, biological, and technological domains.

## 🧮 Harmonic Cascade Equation  
*fₙ = f₀ × (n / (n + 1))*  
- `f₀` = 7.83 Hz *(Schumann Base)*  
- `n` = Index of symbol (1–8)  
This generates a harmonic resonance scale aligned to alpha, theta, and gamma entrainment bands.

---

## 🔁 Cybernetic Loop Equation  
*Vₒᵤₜ = (1 + G·H·G) · Vᵢₙ*  
Where:  
- `Vᵢₙ` = Scalar Input (Schumann)  
- `G` = Aether Gain  
- `H` = Harmonic Oscillator  
- `Vₒᵤₜ` = Entrainment Field Output  
This recursive loop forms a self-sustaining standing scalar wave.

---

## ⚛️ Quantum Modulation Equation  
*E = λ · h · f*  
Where:  
- `E` = Quantum-modulated energy  
- `λ` = Scalar wave arc (nonlinear curve)  
- `h` = Planck's constant  
- `f` = Harmonic frequency of the symbol  
This modulates the output into a quantized state usable for imprinting, broadcasting, or resonance shaping.

## 🛠️ Symbolic Circuit Components  

To build physical or semi-etheric devices using the NN7 Monas circuit:  
- Schumann Pulse Generator (7.83 Hz)  
- PLL Circuit for frequency lock  
- LC Tank Circuit for field expansion  
- Bifilar Tesla Coil Array  
- Diode Gate Array (nonlinear carrier wave)  

Integral yield formula:  
*Vₒᵤₜ = ∫₀ᵀ f(t) dt*
