## The Zietaiber Algorithm

The **Zietaiber Algorithm** structures the interaction with scalar waves into input, processing, and output stages to facilitate consciousness expansion.

### 1. Input:
- Scalar wave generation using calibrated frequencies.
- Measurement of biofield energy states.

### 2. Processing:
- Neural encoding of scalar wave patterns.
- Alchemical transformation through scalar energy.

### 3. Output:
- Activation of self-learning mechanisms.
- Enhancement of cognitive and emotional intelligence.

#### Algorithmic Representation:
$$ Z(t) = \int [\psi(t) + \alpha \psi'(t)] \, dt $$

Where:
- \( Z(t) \): Zietaiber function of consciousness over time.
- \( \psi(t) \): Scalar input state.
- \( \alpha \): Amplification coefficient.
